# sleep-machine

My personal white noise machine running on a RPi. Includes EightSleep Pod control, alarm system, forced wake up and morning announcements.

Uses a rotary encoder to change the alarm time, start/stop the white noise and turn off the alarm.

Run `launcher.sh` - I added a @reboot crontab rule to auto-run this too
